System check identified some issues:

WARNINGS:
?: (mysql.W002) MySQL Strict Mode is not set for database connection 'default'
	HINT: MySQL's Strict Mode fixes many data integrity problems in MySQL, such as data truncation upon insertion, by escalating warnings into errors. It is strongly recommended you activate it. See: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/databases/#mysql-sql-mode
Operations to perform:
  Apply all migrations: admin, auth, contenttypes, sessions, soil_samples
Running migrations:
  No migrations to apply.
