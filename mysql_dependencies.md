The following is needed for MySQL to work with Django.

# 1. Download mysqlclient
    - mysqlclient requires a C++ compiler. If you're on Windows check you have Microsoft Visual C++ installed with the command 'gcc -v'. If you 
    are on Linux or Mac they already come with a C++ compiler
    - If you have a virtual python environment for this project activate it before you install mysqlclient.
    - Run the command: pip install mysqlclient
