# Web Interface for predicted Soil Strength

## Abstract:
Start with your project statement
Sould be concise (~200 words)
Descriptive enough for someone outside to understand

This project is an web interface that enables engineers to predict soil stabilizer for given soil samples using different statistical and machine learning models. 

This web interface allows users to enter either a single soil sample or multiple samples contained in an Excel file. Predicted stabilized soil strength will then be calculated for each sample using four different methods.
